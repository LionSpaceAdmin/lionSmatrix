## üìä CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Core Architecture**: Modern Next.js 15.5 with App Router properly configured
- **Visual System**: Terminal aesthetic with consistent design tokens
- **Component Library**: Terminal UI components (buttons, cards, inputs) implemented
- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Vercel + GCP integration configured
- **API Keys**: Gemini AI and Google OAuth credentials active

### üî¥ Critical Blockers (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)
1. **Build Failure**: Project won't compile due to routing conflicts
2. **Component Export Issues**: Missing exports in terminal-ui and grid components
3. **Route Conflicts**: Dashboard and authentication routes have naming issues
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Several UI components not properly exported
5. **Type Errors**: TypeScript decorator configuration issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Gaps
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth configured but not implemented
- **Gemini Integration**: API key present but no actual implementation
- **Testing**: Zero test coverage
- **Documentation**: No user or developer documentation
- **Monitoring**: No analytics or error tracking
- **SEO**: No metadata or optimization
