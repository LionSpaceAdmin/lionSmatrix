OSINT Investigation: Global Anti-Israel Protest Wave (Post–October 7, 2023)
Introduction
On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, triggering a devastating war in Gaza – and a parallel information war and protest movement around the world. Within hours, long-prepared narratives and networks sprang into action, framing the conflict in polarizing terms. A worldwide wave of pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel protests erupted across Europe and North America, fueled by social media campaigns, activist organizations, and influence networks. This report examines the pre-October 7 infrastructure that primed this response, the key organizers and influencers driving the protests, the geographic spread of demonstrations, the narratives disseminated (e.g. “Gaza genocide,” “Free Palestine,” “Zionism is terrorism”), evidence of amplification by fake/bot accounts, potential state (Iranian) affiliations and funding, and the timeline/synchronization of these efforts. The findings draw on open-source intelligence: investigative reports, social media analysis, and official statements.
1. Pre-October 7 Influence Infrastructure
Prior to Oct. 7, a coordinated online ecosystem was already in place, propagating anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian narratives and priming audiences for mass mobilization. Iranian state-backed media and influence operations played a central role. For example, the International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM) – an Iranian propaganda outfit – had for years produced pro-Iran and pro-Palestinian videos, news articles and memes distributed via networks of sockpuppet social media accounts[1]. These channels pushed themes of Israeli aggression, Western hypocrisy, and Palestinian resistance, helping shape a global narrative of Israel as an oppressor well before the war.
According to a Microsoft Threat Intelligence report, when the war broke out on Oct. 7, Iran immediately “surged support” to Hamas, combining hacking with social media influence operations[2]. Iranian state outlets like Tasnim News quickly began disseminating misleading claims (e.g. falsely alleging Israeli infrastructure hacks) to boost Hamas’s image[3]. However, Microsoft noted no hard evidence that Iran had pre-coordinated the attack with Hamas – rather, Iran’s cyber teams were reactive but extremely rapid in amplifying pro-Hamas messaging after the fact[4]. By late October, virtually all major Iranian cyber and influence actors were engaged in an “all-hands-on-deck” propaganda campaign against Israel[2][5]. This suggests that while the trigger was unexpected, an influence infrastructure was primed to exploit it.
Crucially, inauthentic social media networks had been seeded well in advance. Analysis by the Israeli tech firm Cyabra found that fully 25% of the social media profiles involved in online discussions about the Hamas-Israel war were fake – part of a coordinated bot network working “to positively influence global opinion regarding Hamas”[6]. A Reuters investigation on Oct. 18 likewise reported more than 40,000 fake accounts pushing pro-Hamas narratives on X (Twitter), “thousands of them created more than a year before the attack.” This scale indicates “pre-prepared content and manpower” behind the propaganda surge – a sophistication unprecedented for a militant group’s online presence[7]. In other words, long before Hamas’s operation, an army of bot and sockpuppet accounts was established, ready to flood the information space with Hamas-favorable content when the moment arrived.
Early signs of this preparatory narrative-crafting could be seen in hashtag campaigns and ideological messaging in the months leading up to October. Activist networks circulated terms like “#GazaUnderAttack,” “apartheid Israel,” “genocide” in reference to Israeli actions, building a shared lexicon of outrage. Fringe “alt-news” outlets often aligned with Iran or other anti-West states – such as PressTV (Iran), Al-Mayadeen (pro-Hezbollah), Grayzone and MintPress News (aligned with Iranian/Russian narratives) – pumped out stories portraying Israel as teetering or monstrous, while glorifying “resistance.” This psychological priming laid the groundwork so that once violence erupted, a ready-made narrative (“Palestinians fighting genocide/colonialism”) could dominate protest slogans and online discourse.
Notably, Palestinian activist organizations in the diaspora were also laying infrastructure. The group Samidoun: Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network – later a key protest organizer – had built chapters across Europe and North America and maintained close ties with factions like the PFLP. Prior to Oct. 7, Samidoun and allied groups nurtured communities of supporters both on social media and on the ground (campus clubs, grassroots coalitions). These networks readily pivoted into action when the war began. In sum, the stage was set: narratives, networks, and even bots were pre-positioned to ensure that Hamas’s attack would be immediately reframed as part of a righteous struggle, igniting a global protest wave rather than isolation.
2. Key Organizers and Influence Networks
The protest wave was not purely spontaneous – it was accelerated and amplified by influential individuals and organizations that drove messaging, mobilized crowds, and reinforced each other’s reach. Below is a table of primary actors identified and their roles:
Name/Group
Platform & Audience
Narrative Role
Affiliation/Notes
Jackson Hinkle
X (Twitter) – 2.0+ million followers[8][9]; YouTube
American streamer pushing pro-Hamas, anti-Ukraine and anti-Israel content. Spread viral misinfo (e.g. fake Iran/China military support) for engagement[10][11]. Gained 1.5M new followers post–Oct 7 by posting highly partisan war updates[12][9].
Self-described “MAGA communist” with past pro-Russia stance[8]. Suspended on other platforms for disinfo. Monetized hate engagement on X[13][14].
Sulaiman Ahmed
X – ~720k followers[15]
UK-based influencer, formerly anti-vax, turned anti-Israel propagandist. Frequently tweets graphic war footage with anti-Israel spin, and has been repeatedly fact-checked for false claims[14]. Participates in viral hashtags like “#GazaGenocide”.
Connected with Hinkle and other conspiracy influencers (often retweeted by each other[16]). Leverages X’s paid subscription model to profit from engagement.
Abby Martin (Empire Files)
YouTube – 830k+ subscribers[17]; X – 350k+
Prominent American journalist in the anti-imperialist left. Produces documentaries and posts framing Israel as colonial and genocidal. Amplifies “Free Palestine” and anti-war content to a broad audience.
Host of Empire Files. Affiliated with Grayzone network (close with editor Max Blumenthal)[18]. Formerly worked with RT; deeply critical of US/Israel policy.
Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)
200+ campus chapters across N. America[19]
Leading student organizer network for pro-Palestine activism. On Oct 12, the national SJP declared a “Day of Resistance” with rallies at universities coast-to-coast[19]. SJP’s statement controversially called Hamas’s attack “a historic win for the Palestinian resistance.”[20] This galvanized campus protests (and backlash from officials).
Aligned with the BDS movement and other social justice coalitions. Provided on-the-ground protest infrastructure and legitimacy on campuses. Faced accusations of glorifying terrorism due to their Oct 7 remarks[20][21]. Some chapters later faced administrative sanctions.
Samidoun Network
Facebook/Telegram; Chapters in EU/US/Canada
Transnational activist network with ties to Palestinian leftist factions. Immediately after Oct 7, Samidoun praised the “heroic Palestinian resistance” and urged diaspora supporters “everywhere” to raise flags and organize demonstrations in support[22]. They organized many street protests, teach-ins, and marches in the ensuing weeks.
Linked to the PFLP (Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine). Germany banned Samidoun after Oct 7 for celebrating the Hamas attacks[23][24]. Key figures: Khaled Barakat (PFLP affiliate) and Charlotte Kates. Samidoun openly endorses armed “resistance” as legitimate[25][26].
Quds News Network
X – 2.1 million followers; Telegram channel
Hamas-affiliated media outlet that spread war updates and propaganda. On X, Quds News’s verified account posted misleading and inciting content – e.g. false claims that the IDF had announced an intention to bomb a Gaza hospital[27][28]. Despite being fact-checked, such posts garnered hundreds of thousands of views.
Based in Gaza; functions as Hamas’s English-language propaganda arm (labeled “Hamas-affiliated” by WSJ and others)[27]. Some Quds News accounts were suspended on other platforms for extremism[29].
“Mossad / Mossad Commentary” (Impersonator)
X – grew from <1k to 230k followers in Oct[30][31]
A fake persona account using Israel’s Mossad name and logo. Obtained a “blue check” and posted sensational false content (e.g. video game footage passed off as Israel’s “Iron Beam” laser defense) which amassed millions of views[32][33]. After community fact-checks, it simply changed its display name to “Mossad Commentary” and continued posting.
Likely run by a pro-Palestine or anti-Israel troll (no actual Mossad ties). Example of how X’s paid verification boosted disinformation: the blue check lent unearned credibility while Musk’s platform did little to rein in fakes[30][31].
“Taliban Public Relations Dept. (Commentary)”
X – fluctuating (was “#FreePalestine” account)[34]
Another sockpuppet persona that hijacked Taliban branding. Gained verification just hours before posting a viral Gaza video (of a grieving child) that was actually from Syria years ago[35][33]. The account explicitly switched between pro-Palestine and faux-Taliban identities to surf trending topics.
Run by unknown operator(s) – possibly the same as “Mossad” account owner, given similar tactics. Example of cross-affiliation trolling: using a jihadist persona to cheer on Hamas, adding to confusion and virality. Eventually annotated by fact-checkers, but damage done (millions of views before removal)[34][36].
Dominick “Dom” McGee (@dom_lucre)
X – ~800k followers[37][38]
A US far-right influencer (QAnon promoter) repurposed as an anti-Israel amplifier. Posted numerous false or misleading claims about the war – notably a fake story that Qatar threatened to cut gas supply, which he boosted to 9+ million views[39]. Despite a history of suspension for other offenses, he was reinstated by Musk and joined the pro-Hamas narrative bandwagon.
Represents the convergence of extreme right and pro-Palestine rhetoric on X in the Musk era. McGee’s case shows how accounts that were pushing QAnon/anti-vax content pivoted to Gaza content for engagement. Described by NYT as part of the QAnon community and an election denier[37].
“Sprinter” / “WizardSX”
X – ~500k followers[40][41]
An anonymous X account (name changes: SprinterTeam, SprinterX, WizardSX) that became a prolific disinformation superspreader during the war. Shared at least 20 debunked claims – including AI-generated images, altered videos, and conspiracy memes (e.g. “Ukraine is arming Hamas”)[42][40]. Posts often got hundreds of thousands of views, and the account’s follower count swelled by 60% in the first month of conflict[42][43].
Possibly run by a network or a single opportunist; identity unknown. Despite temporary “restrictions,” the account retained verification and even advertised a backup profile[44]. Illustrates X’s failure to curb high-volume fake news accounts. Sprinter’s reach came to rival mainstream news outlets like Haaretz on the platform[42][40].
Max Blumenthal & Grayzone
X – 380k (Blumenthal); Website/YouTube (Grayzone)
Max Blumenthal (editor of The Grayzone) and his outlet form a hub of “anti-Zionist” and anti-Western commentary. They consistently blasted Israel’s actions as war crimes, questioned reports of Hamas atrocities, and amplified narratives favorable to Hamas, Iran, or Russia. Collaborates with others like Rania Khalek, Aaron Maté (all of whom pushed similar content).
Grayzone is an alt-media site often accused of spreading disinformation and aligning with authoritarian regimes. Blumenthal and colleagues are part of a tight ideological network overlapping with Russian and Iranian state media (Maté is a contributor to RT; Blumenthal to PressTV)[18][45]. They gave intellectual backdrop to the street protests by reframing events (e.g. blaming Israel for hospital blast, downplaying Hamas wrongdoing).
Rania Khalek / BreakThrough
X – ~285k; YouTube (BreakThrough News)
Lebanese-American journalist at BreakThrough News (leftist outlet). Pro-Palestinian, anti-imperialist voice who echoed pro-Hamas talking points and vehemently criticized Israel/U.S. She often highlighted Palestinian suffering and compared Gaza to other US-backed conflicts.
Khalek is closely associated with Grayzone figures (former RT contributor). Represents how fringe left media partnered with on-the-ground activists to spread the same protest calls.
Ali Abunimah / Electronic Intifada
X – ~230k; Electronic Intifada website
A veteran Palestinian activist-journalist. Through Electronic Intifada, he disseminated minute-by-minute updates and historical context casting the Gaza war as the culmination of decades of Israeli “ethnic cleansing.” Promoted boycott campaigns and campus actions.
A key node in the BDS and Palestine solidarity movement for two decades. Abunimah’s messaging helped tie the immediate outrage to a broader political program (sanctions, isolation of Israel).
Table: Key influencers and organizers of the global protest wave, with their platforms, roles, and affiliations. (Sources: X profile stats from June 2025[15][12]; reporting on false claims by Hinkle[10][11], Ahmed & Loupis[14]; ProPublica analysis of X account growth[12][9], misinformation posts by “Mossad,” Taliban PR, Dom_Lucre, Sprinter[27][34][39][40]; Reuters on SJP’s day of action[19][20]; NGO Monitor on Samidoun’s Oct 7 statement[22].)*
Pro-Palestinian demonstration in Rome, Italy (June 2025), where hundreds of thousands marched against Israel’s Gaza offensive. Protesters carried Palestinian flags and signs like “Stop genocide in Gaza,” reflecting the narratives that spread globally after Oct. 7[46][47].
These actors did not work in isolation – they formed a loose but coherent network. On X (Twitter), they frequently amplified each other’s posts via retweets and quote-tweets. For instance, Jackson Hinkle often shared posts from Grayzone or from Gaza-based accounts; Sulaiman Ahmed and others would in turn boost Hinkle’s viral content, creating a feedback loop. Many hosted or joined each other’s Twitter Spaces (audio chatrooms) to reinforce narratives (e.g. joint “Free Palestine” discussions)[16]. There was also cross-platform synergy: a graphic or slogan might originate in a Telegram channel aligned with Hamas or Iran, get picked up by an influencer on X, then be re-packaged into a TikTok video or Instagram infographic by youth activists, and finally appear on a protest placard in a city square.
Organizationally, campus groups like SJP and left-wing coalitions (ANSWER Coalition, Jewish Voice for Peace, etc.) provided physical infrastructure for rallies, while online influencers provided messaging infrastructure. Notably, Iranian influence permeated some of these networks indirectly – for example, Iranian state media would publish talking points (e.g. “Gaza is an open-air prison/genocide”), which were then laundered into Western discourse by Grayzone writers or by viral tweets from accounts like Hinkle’s. This blend of state-linked and grassroots actors created an echo chamber that could drive narratives from fringe to mainstream in hours.
3. Geography of the Protest Wave: Europe and North America
The reach of the protests was truly global, but this investigation centers on Europe and North America, where major cities saw some of the largest demonstrations condemning Israel’s actions in Gaza. Key geographic highlights:
	•	London, UK: London became a focal point for Europe’s pro-Palestine activism. Starting the weekend after Oct. 7, tens of thousands rallied in central London (near the Israeli Embassy and through Westminster) waving Palestinian flags and chanting “Free, Free Palestine.” The numbers swelled with each passing week – an estimated 100,000 protesters by mid-October, and by November 11, organizers claimed up to 300,000 participants in a march calling for a Gaza ceasefire. The protests were largely peaceful, though a few incidents (fireworks thrown, confrontations with police) drew attention. They were coordinated by groups like the Palestine Solidarity Campaign UK and supported by diverse communities (left-wing British activists, Muslim groups, student unions, etc.). London’s rallies featured ubiquitous slogans on banners: “Stop the Gaza Genocide,” “From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will be Free,” and comparisons of Israel to apartheid South Africa or even Nazi Germany. The sheer scale in London indicated a high level of mobilization capability – likely aided by pre-existing networks from previous flare-ups (e.g. the May 2021 Gaza war also saw big London rallies).
	•	Paris, France: In France, pro-Palestinian protests faced initial government pushback. The French Interior Minister attempted to ban pro-Palestine demonstrations in the days after Oct. 7, citing risks of public disorder and antisemitism. Nevertheless, activists defied bans – an Oct. 12 gathering in Paris saw crowds chanting despite police water-cannon dispersal. By late October, courts overruled blanket bans, and large rallies unfolded in Paris (e.g. a march on Oct. 28 that drew ~15,000). Protesters there shouted “Israel assassin, Macron complice!” (calling French President Macron complicit) and “Nous sommes tous Palestiniens” (“We are all Palestinians”). The French far-left (La France Insoumise party, etc.) participated actively. Also notable were Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse, which saw passionate protests given France’s sizeable Muslim population. While Paris did see some antisemitic incidents (e.g. chants of “Khaybar Khaybar” referencing a battle against Jews), the dominant message in public demonstrations was a call to stop Israel’s bombing of Gaza. French authorities maintained a high-alert posture (France went on its highest terror alert after an unrelated school stabbing on Oct. 13, linking it to Middle East tensions[48]). Overall, France’s protests were fervent but somewhat restrained by policing compared to the UK or Italy.
	•	Berlin and Germany: Germany experienced intense contention around pro-Palestinian rallies. Immediately after Oct. 7, small gatherings of Palestinian supporters in Berlin celebrating the Hamas attack (with participants distributing sweets) caused outrage, and authorities quickly banned Hamas symbols and certain slogans. For a period, Berlin police prohibited demonstrations “glorifying violence” – effectively stifling some pro-Gaza rallies. Nonetheless, larger protests did occur: on Oct. 22, thousands marched in Berlin’s Neukölln district under heavy police monitoring. Protesters chanted “Stop the genocide in Gaza” and carried images of Palestinian casualties. German officials took a hard line: Interior Minister Nancy Faeser moved to outlaw groups like Samidoun for alleged Hamas links. (Indeed, Germany banned Samidoun’s operations in October after evidence it was celebrating the Hamas atrocities[49].) Despite this, German civil society held peace vigils and marches calling for a ceasefire – including by Jewish leftist groups who opposed the Netanyahu government. Other German cities (Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg) saw modest rallies. The German case underscores how legal and security measures intersected with grassroots activism – making Germany’s protests more muted and tense than elsewhere.
	•	Rome and Italy: Italy witnessed one of Europe’s largest pro-Palestine turnouts later in the conflict. On November 4 and again on December 9, huge crowds rallied in Rome. On June 7, 2025, a particularly massive march took place, organized by opposition parties on the left – “up to 300,000 people” flooded the streets of Rome, denouncing their government’s support of Israel[50][51]. Demonstrators held signs like “Stop the massacre, stop complicity!” and Italian placards reading “Fermiamo il genocidio a Gaza” (“Stop the genocide in Gaza”)[52][51]. The leader of Italy’s Democratic Party, Elly Schlein, attended and called the turnout “an enormous popular response” against Israel’s war[51][53]. Similar large demonstrations occurred in Naples and Milan. Italy’s protests were notable for broad political backing (entire opposition parties) and framing the issue as one of human rights and Italian values. The imagery of hundreds of thousands in a European capital chanting for Palestine showed how mainstream the cause had become by late 2023.
	•	Other European cities: Madrid and Barcelona in Spain saw large rallies (Barcelona’s city council even briefly illuminated municipal buildings with the Palestinian flag). Athens had protests organized by leftist and Arab migrant groups. Brussels saw demonstrations given its Moroccan and Turkish communities. In Belgium and the Netherlands, some protests occurred (though the Netherlands also had high tensions after a teacher was suspended for pro-Palestine statements, illustrating divisions). Scandinavian cities (Stockholm, Copenhagen) held smaller solidarity events. In the Balkans, protests in Sarajevo and elsewhere tapped historical sympathy for Palestinians. Importantly, the Muslim world (though outside our regional scope) saw enormous rallies – e.g. in Istanbul, Karachi, Kuala Lumpur – which in turn amplified the confidence of protesters in the West that they were part of a global movement.
	•	New York City, USA: In North America, New York was an epicenter. On Oct. 8 (the day after the Hamas attack), a rally in Times Square by pro-Palestinian groups drew a few thousand people – and instant controversy for its timing. Some attendees held signs praising the “resistance” or displaying paragliders (a reference to Hamas attackers), prompting condemnation from officials. As the Gaza bombardment intensified, NYC saw continuous protests: large marches shut down streets in Manhattan, vigils were held for Gaza victims, and campus walkouts occurred at NYU, Columbia, CUNY and more. At Columbia University, on October 12, hundreds of students rallied on campus – masked pro-Palestine students held signs “Free Palestine” and “To Exist is to Resist” facing off across a lawn from pro-Israel students holding photos of Hamas-held hostages[54][55]. Tensions ran high: at one point a heckler yelled at the crowd observing a moment of silence for Gazan victims, saying they should mention Israeli children killed by Hamas[56]. This encapsulates the college climate: heated dueling protests, and administrators caught in the middle. New York also saw one of the largest single demonstrations in the U.S. – on November 4, an estimated 30,000 marched through Midtown calling for a ceasefire. Additionally, Jewish Voice for Peace organized a high-profile direct action on Oct. 27, occupying Grand Central Terminal with hundreds of Jewish Americans staging a sit-in for a Gaza ceasefire. “Not in our name” and “Let Gaza Live” were their messages, showing the protest movement’s diversity (including dissenting Jews).
Pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University in New York (Oct. 2023). Students and supporters chant “Free Palestine” and hold signs like “No one is free when others are oppressed” as they rally on campus[57][58]. U.S. college campuses became flashpoints after Oct. 7, with National SJP organizing a “Day of Resistance” walkout on Oct. 12.[19]
	•	San Francisco & the Bay Area, USA: The Bay Area, with its history of activism, saw major actions. In San Francisco, protesters gathered outside the Israeli Consulate and federal buildings. Notably, on October 18, a coalition of activists shut down the Bay Bridge, parking cars across lanes during morning rush hour and unfurling Palestinian flags and banners reading “End the Siege on Gaza.” This bold direct action led to arrests but garnered widespread attention. Across the bay, in Oakland, a large march took place at the Port of Oakland in November, temporarily blocking an Israeli-owned cargo ship from unloading (echoing a 2014 Gaza war protest tactic). Bay Area demonstrators – including many tech workers – also protested companies like Google for supplying technology to Israel (e.g. Project Nimbus). The slogans mirrored others: “Stop the genocide,” “Zionism = racism,” etc., but with a local flavor of civil disobedience and labor solidarity (dockworker unions voiced support).
	•	Chicago, USA: Chicago has a sizable Palestinian-American community and it mobilized strongly. Thousands marched in the Loop and along Michigan Avenue in late October waving flags. A notable rally on Oct. 21 drew diverse participation, from Palestinian families to local church groups. Chants of “Netanyahu you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide” echoed through downtown. Chicago also saw some counter-protest friction – for instance, a driver was arrested after attempting to plow through a Palestinian protest march (fortunately causing no serious injuries). This underscored security concerns but also the determination of protesters to keep turning out. Nearby Detroit, Michigan experienced an occupation at Wayne State University (students camped out for Gaza), which dovetailed with an online influence operation: interestingly, inauthentic X accounts later tried to smear those student protests as Qatar-funded (a separate influence campaign, see Section 5)[59][60].
	•	Toronto and Canada: In Canada, major cities saw significant demonstrations. Toronto’s Palestinian community led multiple rallies (Oct. 9, thousands at Nathan Phillips Square; later, larger marches down Yonge Street). Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, and Vancouver also had protests. A dramatic incident occurred on Nov. 14 in Vancouver: protesters surrounded a restaurant where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was dining, chanting and demanding he push for a ceasefire[61]. Police had to escort Trudeau out after scuffles (one officer was punched)[61]. Prominent at that Vancouver protest was Charlotte Kates, the Samidoun coordinator, leading chants of “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and “Justin Trudeau you can’t hide, you’re committing genocide!”[62]. This illustrated how activist leaders traveled or emerged to synchronize messages (Kates being an American based in Canada). Overall, Canadian protests pressured the Liberal government to shift its UN voting and rhetoric on Gaza, showing tangible political impact.
Across all these geographies, a pattern emerged: local grassroots organizers (student groups, Muslim associations, left-wing parties, NGOs like Amnesty/HRW chapters) would schedule protests, often weekly “Day of Rage” or weekend marches, and these would be amplified by the global narrative machinery online. Thus, a protest in London or Rome would be live-streamed and shared worldwide as inspiration, while a campus rally’s video might go viral and energize crowds abroad. By late October, solidarity protests were synchronized across cities – for example, on the weekend of Nov. 4–5, huge rallies took place concurrently in London, New York, Los Angeles, Paris, and elsewhere, all echoing the demand for a Gaza ceasefire. This gave a sense of a worldwide movement in lockstep.
It is important to note that while overwhelmingly peaceful, these protests did coincide with a spike in antisemitic incidents and inter-communal tensions in the West. Governments reported surges in hate speech and security threats. For instance, the UK saw a 400% increase in antisemitic incidents in the two weeks after Oct. 7[63]. In the U.S., a tragic hate-crime occurred in Illinois (a landlord killed a Muslim boy in anger over the war)[64]. Protest organizers usually condemned such violence, insisting their target was Israeli policy/Zionism, not Jewish people. Still, the charged atmosphere led some cities to boost police presence at synagogues and mosques alike. This context sometimes put protest leaders on the defensive, having to clarify that chants like “Intifada” or “Globalize the Intifada” were calls for resistance, not terrorism. Nonetheless, visual slogans like “Zionism = Terrorism” – seen on signs from New York to London – blurred that line and were seized upon by critics as evidence of extremism. (One widely circulated photo showed a protester in New York on Oct. 7 holding a sign “ZIONISM IS TERRORISM,” which drew outrage in conservative media[65].) Thus, the geographic spread of protests also meant a spread of controversy and societal debate about the line between legitimate protest and hate.
4. Narrative Dissemination and Amplification Tactics
From the outset of the conflict, specific narratives and slogans were deliberately promoted to shape public perception and galvanize protests. Chief among these were:
	•	“Gaza Genocide” – This term became a rallying cry to characterize Israel’s military response as an attempt to exterminate Palestinians. Variations like “Stop the Gaza Genocide” appeared on placards globally, and the hashtag #GazaGenocide trended widely on X and Instagram. Notably, by late October, even medical and scholarly voices used the term – e.g. an Oct. 30 Lancet article titled “Stop the Gaza genocide immediately” by a Gaza doctor[66]. Protesters and influencers argued that the scale of Israeli bombardment (thousands of civilians killed) met the definition of genocide, a claim fiercely debated. The narrative served to morally simplify the conflict for observers: if a genocide is happening, urgent mass protest is not only justified but required. It also flipped the script on October 7 – instead of focusing on Hamas’s massacre, attention turned to Israel as the greater perpetrator. This narrative spread before Oct. 7 in some activist circles (alleging a “slow genocide” via blockade), but post-7th it exploded across mainstream discourse. By June 2025, Al Jazeera would routinely refer to Israel’s “genocidal assault in Gaza” when reporting on European rallies[46][67], indicating how normalized the term became in protest-aligned media.
	•	“Free Palestine” – A long-standing slogan that surged anew. Hashtags like #FreePalestine and #PalestineWillBeFree were among the most used on social platforms post-Oct. 7. This slogan, while generic, unified a broad coalition – from liberal humanitarians simply wanting a ceasefire to hardline activists implying the elimination of Israel (“from the river to the sea”). At street protests, “Free, Free Palestine!” call-and-response chants were ubiquitous. The simplicity and positivity of the phrase made it a branding tagline for the movement, seen on flags, shirts, and social media profile filters. It linked contemporary events to the broader historic cause of Palestinian statehood, thus ensuring protests weren’t seen as only anti-Israel, but pro-Palestinian freedom.
	•	“Zionism is Terrorism” / “Zionism = Racism” – These sharper slogans also spread, especially among leftist and Muslim demonstrators. By equating Zionism (the ideology of a Jewish homeland) with terrorism, activists sought to delegitimize Israel’s founding narrative and cast Palestinian violence as justified “anti-terror” resistance. Signage with this phrase was observed in multiple cities. For example, at a rally in Dearborn, Michigan, a banner read “Zionism = terrorism; Israel = apartheid.” In New York, protesters slapped stickers on walls declaring “Zionism is terrorism”[68]. Such messaging was amplified by Iranian and militant media as well – Iran’s supreme leader’s social accounts often use “Zionist regime” alongside terms like terrorist or satanic. The spread of this slogan demonstrates the radicalization of narrative: it’s no longer just criticism of Israeli policy, but an attack on Israel’s legitimacy and on supporters of Zionism (which includes most Jews). This did raise concerns of antisemitism, as critics pointed out that conflating Zionism with evil effectively demonizes the majority of Jews who support Israel’s existence. Nonetheless, within the protest movement, this framing gained traction as a retort to Western narratives that Hamas are “terrorists” – flipping it to say Israel/Zionists are the real terrorists.
	•	Martyrdom and Resistance – Terms like “resistance,” “intifada,” “martyrs” were celebrated in protest circles, borrowing directly from Palestinian militant lexicon. The hashtag #GlobalizeTheIntifada trended after a Palestinian student group in Gaza called for a “Global Intifada” in late May 2023 – a call that Samidoun and others resurfaced and amplified in October[69]. “Intifada” (uprising) became a positive buzzword, invoked in chants (“Intifada, Intifada – long live the Intifada!”) to encourage a worldwide uprising. Likewise, protesters often referred to the dead in Gaza as “martyrs,” a term popularized by Hamas and others to honor those killed by the enemy. This language shows how the ideological narrative (with quasi-religious and militant overtones) was injected into global protest culture, not just contained in the Middle East. For example, at many U.S. campus rallies, one would hear speakers say “Glory to the martyrs of Gaza, may their sacrifice not be in vain.” Such narrative elements served to emotionally charge the movement and tie it to the on-the-ground fighters in Gaza.
The dissemination channels for these narratives were both organic and orchestrated. Social media was paramount: X (Twitter), in particular, became a Wild West of war content. Verified accounts with blue checks (many of them new or repurposed) pushed waves of mis-contextualized images and rumors. Community Notes (X’s user-generated fact-checks) tried to keep up but often lagged far behind viral falsehoods. For instance, a heart-wrenching video of a sobbing boy widely shared on X (as Gaza footage) was actually old Syrian footage – yet it spread to 600k+ views via a newly-verified “#FreePalestine” account before being corrected[35][33]. The false post vastly outpaced the reach of the later correction note. ProPublica’s analysis found over 2,000 misleading tweets by verified accounts in the first month, collectively viewed half a billion times, compared to only one-fifth that number of views on the fact-checking notes[70][29]. This imbalance highlights how narrative propaganda (even if false) can dominate attention during fast-moving events.
Fake and bot accounts were a significant force multiplier for narrative spread. Cyabra’s investigation concluded that a coordinated bot network was actively amplifying Hamas-friendly narratives, comprising about a quarter of all profiles discussing the war[6]. Many of these bots would latch onto trending hashtags (for example, hijacking #CeasefireNOW or #FromTheRiverToTheSea) and mass-post or mass-reply to boost their visibility. Reuters quoted Cyabra’s VP noting 40,000+ fake accounts pushing Hamas narratives, including sleeper accounts made long ago[7]. These accounts helped trending topics reach critical mass and created an illusion of widespread grassroots sentiment. Inauthentic coordination was not one-sided: separate investigations showed pro-Israel bot campaigns too (e.g. Israeli-linked firms ran bots accusing Palestinian NGOs of terrorism)[71][72]. But in the context of protests, the pro-Hamas/Palestine side had a striking online presence that was at least partly manufactured. The high sophistication and longevity of these networks (some active for a year+) hint at state or proxy backing – most likely Iranian or Hamas-affiliated cyber operators.
Platforms like Telegram, TikTok, and Instagram also played roles. Telegram was the home ground for Hamas: the Al-Qassam Brigades channel more than tripled its followers (205k to 619k) in the days after Oct. 7[73][74], blasting out unfiltered war footage. Content from Telegram (some extremely graphic or propagandistic) often migrated to Twitter and Instagram via activist-curated posts. TikTok saw a flood of emotional content – footage of protests, Gaza civilian plight, etc. – often set to music and reaching younger audiences. Certain TikTok clips of large demos (like crowds in London chanting on Oct. 21) garnered millions of views, further energizing the narrative that “the whole world is out for Palestine.” However, TikTok also struggled with misinformation: for example, old footage of conflicts in Syria or video game clips were falsely tagged as live from Gaza, accumulating huge view counts before moderation.
Another aspect of dissemination was the use of visual symbolism and memes. The paraglider (used by Hamas militants on Oct. 7) became an icon that some protestors and online supporters embraced – it appeared on signs and t-shirts, essentially memeifying a tool of attack into a symbol of defiance. Likewise, slogans like “Oct 7, 2023 – Palestine’s 9/11” were pushed in some circles to frame the attack as a legitimate military operation against a powerful occupier (this comparison was hugely controversial). On the flip side, anti-Palestinian actors pushed their own disinfo (claims that footage of Gaza destruction was staged or that Palestinians were “actors”), which muddied the waters[75][76]. All of this contributed to what one analyst called an “information crisis” during the war, where the truth struggled to surface above the flood of propaganda[70][77]. In such an environment, simple emotionally resonant narratives (“genocide in Gaza!”) had an advantage.
It’s also instructive to see specific amplification case studies: For example, a false rumor that Qatar’s emir threatened to cut gas exports unless Israel stopped bombing was propagated by nearly 70 verified X accounts, amassing over 15 million views[39]. One of the largest boosts came from Dom Lucre’s tweet (9M views)[78][37]. This rumor, although debunked (it was based on an unrelated 2017 speech[39]), spread at the height of the war narrative, reinforcing the idea that even Arab states were poised to act against Israel – a useful myth to rally protesters and pressure Western governments. Only a tiny fraction of those who saw the claim saw the fact-check note that followed[79]. Another case: the “Israeli hospital bombing” on Oct. 17 (the Al-Ahli hospital explosion) – within hours, misinformation spread wildly that Israel had deliberately bombed a hospital killing 500. Verified pro-Palestine accounts like Quds News posted a fake screenshot alleging the IDF had warned about hitting that hospital[27][33], which got over 500k views. Although independent investigations later found the explosion likely caused by a misfired Palestinian rocket, the narrative “Israel bombed a hospital full of civilians” became cemented in protest discourse. It fueled some of the largest demonstrations (e.g. an outpouring in Amman, Jordan that almost stormed the Israeli embassy, and anger on Western streets as well). Community Notes or official statements correcting the record came too late to fully reverse the impact. This illustrates how speed and emotional salience of a narrative often trump accuracy in the social media era.
In summary, the protest movement’s messaging was propelled by a potent mix of genuine sentiment, crafted slogans, and strategic amplification by networks of influencers and fake accounts. The narratives of genocide, resistance, and freedom resonated deeply, especially as harrowing images from Gaza circulated. At the same time, those narratives were weaponized by interested actors to ensure that outrage (rather than nuance) dominated the conversation. The result was a highly mobilized global public opinion environment – millions believed a version of events that spurred them to hit the streets and demand action against Israel.
5. Funding, Coordination, and State-Affiliated Influence
A critical question is to what extent this protest wave and its narratives were orchestrated or funded by state actors, especially Iran and its proxies, versus being an organic reaction. While much of the street-level activism was grassroots, multiple OSINT findings indicate certain states and organizations did play a behind-the-scenes role in amplifying and possibly coordinating the campaigns.
Iran’s Role: Iran, as Hamas’s patron and an arch-opponent of Israel, had a clear interest in fanning global opinion against Israel’s Gaza offensive. Evidence shows that Iran engaged a full spectrum of influence operations once the war began. Microsoft’s analysis detailed how Iranian cyber units combined hack-and-leak tactics with propaganda dissemination to maximize impact[2][5]. For example, Iranian hackers calling themselves “Cyber Avengers” (likely IRGC-affiliated) claimed responsibility – via Iranian media – for phantom cyberattacks on Israeli infrastructure on Oct. 7 to create an image of Israel under comprehensive assault[3]. These claims were false or exaggerated, but Iranian outlets pushed them to boost morale and incite further action.
On the information front, Iranian state media (PressTV, Fars News, Tasnim) and officials hammered the narrative that Israel is committing genocide with Western backing. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei gave speeches praising the “resistance” and predicting Israel’s imminent downfall, which were widely circulated with subtitles. Tehran’s proxies also joined in: for instance, Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah made a November speech framing the war as part of a U.S.-Zionist plot, effectively rallying his followers and justifying global protest. Iranian diplomats and propaganda arms in the West (like the Iranian diaspora-backed TV channels and social media fronts) helped coordinate messaging – one Iranian “soft war” tactic is to use cultural centers and friendly NGOs abroad to mobilize demonstrations under slogans of peace/justice.
One concrete link: the International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM), as mentioned earlier, is an Iranian-run content factory identified by Graphika. It has a history of pushing pro-Palestinian content and anti-Israel conspiracy theories[1]. Leading into and during the war, IUVM likely churned out materials (videos, graphics, articles) that were shared across sympathetic networks. Such materials can indirectly feed protests – e.g. an IUVM-produced video claiming “Israel is faking evidence of Hamas atrocities” might be shown at a teach-in or shared by influencers to justify the protests’ stance.
Iranian Funding of Proxies: Iran also supports militant groups and NGOs that in turn have links to activism abroad. For instance, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are materially backed by Iran; their media arms (like Qassam Brigades’ Telegram, PIJ’s Al-Quds Brigades media) pumped out content that was picked up by diaspora activists. The group Samidoun, which was extremely active in organizing Western protests, has leadership (like Barakat and Kates) who openly coordinate with Iranian state media and pro-Iran forums[80][81]. Barakat even gave interviews on Iran’s PressTV calling for armed uprisings[82][83]. This suggests at least an ideological and communications synergy with Iran’s agenda. Samidoun and similar groups may not get direct Iranian payments (though one can’t rule out covert support), but Iran’s ecosystem strongly bolsters their efforts with exposure and ideological framing.
Additionally, Iran likely funneled money to sympathetic causes in the West through charities and community organizations. Past cases (like the UK’s Islamic Centre of England, tied to Iran, or funding of certain student associations) indicate Iran’s willingness to invest in influence. In this war, Iranian officials publicly praised the worldwide protests – framing them as a sign that “the conscience of the world” rejects Israel’s actions, and urging more. The Iranian Foreign Ministry’s Telegram channel would share videos of London and New York rallies, effectively endorsing and encouraging the protesters. This quasi-official approval might not equate to direct orchestration, but it shows a convergence of goals: Iran wanted global pressure on Israel, and the protests delivered that.
Other State or Semi-State Actors: Apart from Iran, other players in the “Axis of Resistance” and beyond contributed to the protest momentum:
	•	Hamas itself called for mass protests. Former Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal, speaking from Qatar on Oct. 11, urged Muslims worldwide to hold a “Day of Jihad” on Friday, Oct. 13 – effectively a call for mass demonstrations (and implicitly, possibly violence) in support of Palestine. This message spread widely on Arabic social media. While it also sparked security fears in the West (some interpreted “Day of Jihad” as a terror threat), in many places it translated into large peaceful protests after Friday prayers on 10/13 (e.g. thousands rallied in cities from Amman to London that day). Meshaal’s call thus served as a coordination point across countries.
	•	Turkey’s government (though not a direct adversary of Israel pre-war) became very vocal post-Oct. 7, with President Erdoğan labeling Israel a “war criminal” and organizing a massive pro-Palestine rally in Istanbul on Oct. 28. Turkish state media amplified narratives similar to Iran’s. This added to the chorus of state-backed voices legitimizing the protests.
	•	Qatar, while playing a mediator role, also allowed Hamas spokesmen to use its Al Jazeera network and gave significant coverage to protest movements. Al Jazeera’s framing (widely watched by Arabic and English audiences) was sympathetic to the protesters – even calling some Western rallies “Europe rallies for end to Gaza genocide”[84][85], explicitly using the activists’ terminology. Qatar thus indirectly boosted the narrative that the global public opposed Israel.
	•	Russia – Though the Ukraine war is its main focus, Russia also found common cause in undermining Western support for Israel. Russian officials and RT (Russia Today) echoed claims of Israeli genocide and highlighted protest crackdowns in Western cities to discredit Western governments. Some of the influencers (like Jackson Hinkle, who previously pushed pro-Kremlin content[8][86], and Max Blumenthal who has appeared on Russian media) created a nexus between Russian and pro-Palestinian propaganda. There were even instances of Russian-origin social media accounts switching to post about Gaza, simply to ride the wave of anti-West sentiment. However, Russia’s role was more opportunistic than central; Iran remained the primary state cheerleader of the protests.
Interestingly, an OSINT twist revealed that not only U.S. adversaries played this game – Israel and its allies also waged influence campaigns in response. The Atlantic Council’s DFRLab uncovered a network of over 50 fake X accounts in spring 2024 that targeted U.S./Canadian politicians with messages blaming Qatar for campus protests, clearly trying to discredit the pro-Palestine student movement by framing it as foreign agitation[59][71]. This network was linked to an Israeli marketing firm (Stoic) and funded by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs[87][72]. The accounts used hashtags like “#QatarBuysUSA” while replying to officials about student sit-ins[88]. Meta and OpenAI confirmed the network’s inauthenticity, and it was taken down[89][72]. This episode shows that information warfare around the protests had multiple fronts: even as Iran-linked networks boosted pro-Palestine narratives, an Israel-linked network tried a counter-narrative to erode sympathy for those protests (by insinuating they were Qatari-sponsored extremism). Both were covert operations aiming to sway public and elite opinion.
Funding streams for protest-organizing groups came under scrutiny. Pro-Israel advocacy groups alleged that some U.S. campus activism was indirectly financed by overseas donors (for example, National SJP has ties to American Muslims for Palestine, which some accuse of links to Islamist funding – though evidence is debated). In Europe, security services monitored whether NGOs organizing rallies had connections to Hezbollah or Iran’s networks. No smoking-gun public evidence emerged of Iran directly funding street protests in the West – and indeed, much of the organizing was done by local volunteers. However, it’s clear that Iranian proxies like PressTV, Al-Mayadeen, Quds News, and Hezbollah’s Al-Manar provided propaganda fuel which the protest movement relied on for content and justification. When PressTV broadcasts a graphic narrative of “genocide in Gaza” 24/7, it reinforces the conviction of protesters and provides them with talking points. Similarly, outlets like The Grayzone and MintPress (which are often funded through opaque means, possibly including donations from like-minded benefactors in places like Iran or Russia) functioned as amplifiers. Grayzone’s Max Blumenthal even traveled to a propaganda conference in Russia in 2023 – illustrating the global anti-West network that also embraced the Palestine cause.
In summary, while the street energy was organic, the information environment was carefully cultivated in part by state and quasi-state actors. Iran stood to gain strategically from a worldwide outcry that could restrain Israel and its Western allies. By leveraging its media arms and allied influencers, Iran helped ensure the protest narrative (“Israel = genocidal, Hamas = justified resistance”) reached a broad audience. Other actors, including adversaries of the West and even Western fringe groups, piggybacked on the moment to advance their own agendas (be it eroding Western unity or simply sowing chaos in information). This convergence of interests created a kind of synchronicity between disparate players – from Tehran’s halls of power to the Twitter feeds of American conspiracy theorists – all pushing in the same direction of amplifying anti-Israel sentiment.
6. Timeline and Synchronization of the Campaign
Mapping out the timeline reveals how quickly the protest campaign ignited and how synchronized certain actions were, despite spanning many countries. Key timeline points include:
	•	Pre-October 7, 2023: As discussed, narratives were already simmering. In late September, there were social media spikes around incidents in the West Bank and at Al-Aqsa Mosque, with hashtags like #SavePalestine trending. No explicit public call for a global protest was issued pre-Oct 7, but networks like SJP and Samidoun maintained readiness (e.g. SJP held its annual conference in September and shared toolkits for campus activism). In hindsight, thousands of dormant bot accounts were in place, and content vaults (videos, graphics) existed to be deployed.
	•	October 7, 2023 (The Trigger Event): Hamas attacks Israel in the morning. Within hours, as Israel reels, the information response starts: Samidoun releases a triumphant statement that very day calling supporters to demonstrate “as the resistance rises”[22]. In Gaza and the West Bank, celebrations break out – footage of these circulate online and among diaspora. By the evening of Oct 7, small impromptu rallies or flash mobs occur in some cities (e.g. a few dozen in New York’s Little Palestine neighborhood, some gatherings in Jordan and Lebanon). Online, pro-Palestine influencers are uncharacteristically celebratory (since usually they condemn violence) – this tone later shifts once the focus turns to Gaza’s suffering.
	•	Oct 8–9, 2023: Israel begins heavy retaliation in Gaza. Protest mobilization accelerates. On Oct 8 (Sunday), larger protests occur: in Istanbul (hundreds of thousands), in Damascus and Baghdad (crowds storming at symbols of Israel/U.S.), and notable in the West – e.g. the Times Square, NYC rally where protesters chanted anti-Israel slogans and some held Hamas paraphernalia, drawing media attention. That same day in London, a spontaneous protest at the Israeli Embassy saw clashes with police; at least one man was arrested for allegedly assaulting officers. The narrative focus starts shifting to Gaza casualties as images of destroyed buildings and wounded children circulate widely. Influencers like Hinkle pivot from applauding Hamas’s “victory” to emphasizing Israeli “war crimes.” The hashtag #GazaUnderAttack trends globally. By Oct 9, many Western activists issue statements or petitions condemning Israel – e.g. the controversial Harvard student letter holding Israel entirely responsible (signed Oct 9)[90]. This letter itself became a flashpoint, making headlines and prompting doxxing attempts[91], which in turn galvanized more student activism in solidarity.
	•	Oct 10–11, 2023: Protests continue and grow. Israel’s siege of Gaza (cutting off electricity, etc.) is announced, fueling outrage. The first major organized demonstrations take shape for the coming weekend. National SJP and other groups coordinate; WhatsApp/Telegram threads of activists buzz with plans. Online, a flood of mis/disinformation peaks: deepfake clips, old videos mislabeled, and outright fake claims proliferate (as documented by DFRLab on Oct 12[92][93]). For example, conspiracy theories that Israel allowed the attack to happen (a “false flag”) gain some traction, amplified by a network of suspicious accounts from Egypt and elsewhere[94][95]. This adds to protestors’ talking points (“Israel let its own people die as pretext” – a fringe but present idea). The stage is set for multi-platform synchronization: activists are using Facebook events, Eventbrite, and texts to mobilize on the ground, while influencers coordinate messaging on X and Instagram.
	•	Oct 12, 2023 (SJP “Day of Resistance”): This Thursday marks the first coordinated multi-city action in the West. National SJP’s call results in protests or walkouts at over 100 universities across the U.S. and Canada[19][96]. In many campuses, hundreds participate, often counter-protested by pro-Israel students. The simultaneity is striking – from the East Coast (Columbia, NYU, Harvard) to the Midwest (University of Chicago, dozens of state schools) to the West (UCLA, Berkeley), students left classes to rally. This event showed a degree of synchronization via a central body (NSJP) uncommon in past Israel-Palestine activism, indicating strong network ties. The fallout included official condemnations (e.g. University of Arizona’s president calling SJP’s Hamas-support statement antithetical to university values[97]). Some SJP chapters faced threats; one (Arizona) even canceled its protest citing safety[97]. Still, the day was a success in terms of visibility and gave momentum heading into a weekend of broader protests.
	•	Oct 13, 2023 (Global Friday Protests): As mentioned, ex-Hamas leader Meshaal’s call for a “Day of Jihad” made Oct 13 a focal point. After Friday prayers, massive crowds pour out in many Muslim-majority countries (e.g. tens of thousands in Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Tunisia – though these are outside our main scope, they influenced global sentiment). In Europe, after-work protests happen in cities like London (a large rally at the embassy), Paris (despite bans, crowds gathered), and Berlin (where police broke up a gathering). In the U.S., that evening saw marches in cities with big Muslim populations like Dearborn (where thousands rallied outside city hall). The synchronized timing – Friday after prayers – gave a weekly rhythm that would persist (with subsequent big protests often occurring on Fridays or Saturdays). Meanwhile, online jihadist propaganda spiked due to Meshaal’s rhetoric, causing Western security agencies to monitor protests closely on this day for any violence (none significant occurred in the West, fortunately). Essentially, Oct 13 globalized the protest movement beyond just activists – it brought out ordinary Muslim citizens in solidarity, which in turn emboldened Western protesters that they had a worldwide community behind them.
	•	Oct 14–15, 2023 (Weekend Rallies): This weekend saw huge demonstrations in Western capitals for the first time since the war began. London on Oct 14 had around 100,000 people[85][98] – one of the largest pro-Palestine rallies in UK history to that point. Protesters marched from BBC headquarters to Trafalgar Square. The next day, New York had a major march, and Toronto saw thousands at a downtown protest. The synchronized slogan was “Ceasefire Now!” as reports of a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza dominated news. Social media helped synchronize chants and optics – videos of Londoners chanting “From the river to the sea” were circulating as New York protesters gathered, who then adopted the same chant. We begin to see identical banners and flags (Palestinian flag in one hand, the flag of the host country in the other) in different cities, suggesting either coordination or simply mimetic behavior. Some of this was facilitated by activist travel – e.g. Palestinian diaspora leaders flew city to city to speak at rallies (one prominent young Gaza activist based in the US was in DC one day, NYC the next, then London the week after). International NGOs (Amnesty, etc.) also coordinated messaging this weekend, launching petitions and having observers at protests.
	•	Oct 17, 2023 (Hospital Blast reaction): The explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza on Oct 17 became a flashpoint that turbo-charged protests. Early Palestinian claims of an Israeli airstrike causing 500 deaths were widely believed (and promoted by groups like Quds News Network on X[27][33]). That night, spontaneous angry protests erupted in Amman, Beirut, Istanbul, and beyond – including attempts to storm Israeli (and even U.S.) diplomatic sites in the Middle East. In Western cities on Oct 18 and 19, emergency protests were called to mourn the victims and condemn the hospital bombing. Turnout swelled, since the incident touched a nerve as a symbol of Palestinian civilian suffering. Though later evidence pointed to a misfired Palestinian rocket, the narrative that Israel bombed a hospital full of refugees became fixed in many minds. Protest chants and signs referenced it frequently (“Stop bombing hospitals,” “Who bombs hospitals? Israel!” became slogans). This event showed tight synchronization between events on the ground and protest waves – nearly in real-time, a tragedy (framed a certain way) led to surges in people taking to the streets from Paris to Karachi. It also hardened attitudes; fence-sitters who had watched quietly might have joined protests after this, believing a red line was crossed.
	•	Late Oct to Nov 2023 (Sustained Campaign): Through late October and into November, the protest movement maintained strength and even grew. Key moments of synchronization included: a Global Day of Action on Nov 4–5, when activists in many countries coordinated large rallies (e.g. the National March on Washington, DC on Nov 4 drew an estimated 100,000, concurrent with a 300,000-person march in London on Nov 4 and large demos in other capitals). This was the result of weeks of planning – e.g. Samidoun and ANSWER Coalition in the U.S. worked with European leftist parties to time these marches together, aiming for a global news splash. Indeed, that weekend media headlined the “worldwide protests for Gaza.”
Throughout November, as Israeli ground operations intensified, campaigns synchronized around themes: one week, the focus was “End the Siege” (pushing for aid convoys – activists even rallied at Egyptian embassies to open Rafah crossing). Another week, it was “General Strike for Palestine” – on Nov 15, some groups attempted to organize a walkout from work in multiple countries (results were mixed, but it showed the attempt at cross-border campaign ideas). Social media groups with international membership (on Reddit, WhatsApp, etc.) helped share these ideas.
	•	Dec 2023 and beyond: The protest wave continued into December albeit with some fatigue. Major cities still saw big turnouts whenever a horrific Gaza news hit (e.g. after reports of hundreds of children killed in a single day, protests would spike). In December, a noteworthy synchronization was around Truce/Hostage deal developments – when Israel and Hamas agreed to brief truces to exchange hostages for prisoners, protest groups cautiously welcomed the pauses but insisted on a full ceasefire. After the war resumed, protests picked up again. A one-year anniversary protest (Oct 2024) was also anticipated and indeed held, showing enduring networks.
Evidence of Coordination: While much of the “synchronization” can be explained by common reactions to news and the connective power of social media, there are hints of deliberate coordination:
	•	The National SJP Day of Resistance (Oct 12) and the Nov 4 global marches show that central organizers can synchronize hundreds of local chapters with a single call. This implies robust communication channels (likely Signal/WhatsApp groups of student leaders, etc.). The fact that 200 SJP chapters all mobilized on Oct 12[19] suggests planning at least a few days prior (likely immediately after Oct 7, NSJP leadership decided on a date and sent guidance).
	•	Shared branding and materials: Many protests across different cities used the same posters, flyers, and online graphics, often produced by a single source (e.g. a design with “STOP GAZA GENOCIDE” in dripping blood font was seen in multiple countries – possibly originating from a popular Instagram activist artist). Samidoun and allied groups circulated printable posters (through their websites) that were then visibly used in protests from Vancouver to Berlin. This is a form of coordination – providing unified visuals to disparate locales.
	•	Simultaneous chants and messaging: It was observed that new slogans or hashtags would quickly propagate. For example, when protesters in Arabic-speaking countries began the chant “Allahu Akbar” (God is Great) in rallies – something not common in earlier Western demos – within days similar chants occurred in Western protests, reflecting a blending of secular left and religious Muslim narratives. This likely came through videos shared and conscious incorporation by protest organizers wanting to show inclusivity with the Muslim community.
Despite these connections, it’s important to note the protests were not run by a single entity globally. There was no “puppet master” coordinating every move – rather it was a confluence of aligned efforts, where sometimes explicit coordination happened and other times it was spontaneous imitation.
Synchronization with media cycles: Activists were very savvy in timing their campaigns to media interest. For instance, large protests were often scheduled on weekends (to maximize turnout and coverage) and specifically timed ahead of key diplomatic meetings (e.g. rallies took place in New York and San Francisco just before President Biden visited Israel, to influence U.S. stance). In the UK, a huge London march was held on Armistice Day (Nov 11), which was controversial but guaranteed headlines juxtaposing remembrance day with Gaza. These choices show strategic thinking to ensure the movement stayed in the public eye and pressured policymakers constantly.
Finally, it’s worth noting that Israeli officials themselves acknowledged the impact of this global protest wave. Israeli President Isaac Herzog lamented in late October that Israel was “losing the battle on social media” and thus in world opinion, indicating the efficacy of the protest narratives. The Israeli government and supportive NGOs scrambled to counter with their own PR – but the sheer synchronization and volume of the pro-Palestine voices often drowned out official Israeli messaging on platforms like X. This global sentiment in turn influenced political positions (e.g. by December 2023, some European governments started more vocally criticizing Israel’s operations, reflecting their public pressure).
Conclusion: The anti-Israel protest wave after Oct. 7, 2023 was unprecedented in scale and coordination. It combined genuine grassroots fury with carefully cultivated narratives and savvy use of digital platforms. Pre-existing pro-Palestine networks and state-aligned influence operations intersected to amplify the message that Israel’s actions in Gaza were intolerable and must be stopped. Key influencers and organizations – from student activists to online propagandists – drove the mobilization across continents. The movement’s messaging coalesced around powerful frames (“genocide,” “resistance,” “Free Palestine”) that spread rapidly both online and on the streets, often boosted by inauthentic actors and bots. While largely decentralized, the campaign showed elements of synchronization, suggesting information-sharing and common strategic goals, particularly encouraged by Iranian and allied entities.
The result was that, almost immediately after the Hamas attack and Israel’s response, a global narrative battle was in full swing: one which Hamas and its backers largely succeeded in shifting to Israel’s conduct, galvanizing hundreds of thousands worldwide to protest in what they believed was a fight against injustice and genocide. This OSINT analysis highlights how the modern information ecosystem – social media dynamics, influence networks, and transnational activism – can facilitate rapid, worldwide mobilization around a conflict, blurring the lines between authentic civil society protest and coordinated information campaign.

An Analytical Deep-Dive into the Pro-Iran / Anti-Israel Influence Networks Post-October 7, 2023
I. Strategic Landscape & Network Synthesis
A. Executive Summary
The information environment following the terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, has been characterized by a complex and multi-pronged influence campaign targeting public opinion and political discourse in the West. Analysis of this ecosystem reveals that the surge in anti-Israel/pro-Iran narratives is not a single, spontaneous phenomenon but a coordinated effort involving a diverse array of actors. The primary finding of this investigation is the emergence of a highly effective, hybrid threat model wherein state-backed media, designated militant groups, and seemingly independent civil society organizations converge on a synchronized narrative. This coordination is further supported by financially motivated cybercriminal groups that weaponize ideological conflict for profit. This report demonstrates how these disparate elements form a cohesive and resilient network, exploiting legal and technological vulnerabilities to achieve strategic objectives. The central theme of this network is the cultivation of a narrative that delegitimizes Israel, frames its actions as an "international atrocity" , and seeks to undermine support from its allies.
B. The Post-Oct 7 Information Ecosystem: A Global Contagion
The attacks of October 7, 2023, served as a catalyst, fundamentally altering the global information landscape. The conflict rapidly evolved into a "world war online" , characterized by a deluge of online propaganda and disinformation. The online surge translated into unprecedented offline mobilization, with the Crowd Counting Consortium recording nearly 12,400 pro-Palestine protests in the United States alone from October 7, 2023, to June 7, 2024, significantly outnumbering pro-Israel demonstrations.
This dynamic creates a powerful feedback loop. The sheer volume and frequency of physical protests serve as tangible proof of the movement's momentum, lending an aura of authenticity and widespread support to the online narratives. This real-world validation, in turn, draws new participants into the digital information network, further amplifying the core messages. The synchronized nature of this global mobilization suggests a deliberate and successful effort to translate online propaganda into mass public action. This convergence of digital and physical domains is a defining characteristic of the post-October 7 information environment, as the online and offline worlds reinforce one another to create a more compelling and difficult-to-counter information contagion.
C. The Triad of Influence: A Framework for Analysis
To deconstruct this complex network, this report utilizes a "Triad of Influence" framework, which identifies three distinct but highly collaborative pillars of the influence campaign. These pillars are not independent but are deeply interconnected, with information and resources flowing between them.
 * State & Proxy Actors: These are the top-down, resourced, and centrally controlled elements of the network. They include state media like Press TV and state-affiliated lobbying groups in the West. Their role is to set the overarching narrative and provide a consistent stream of propaganda.
 * Militant & Semi-State Actors: This pillar encompasses the on-the-ground militant organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah. They are the primary source of operational footage and graphic content, which serves to justify their actions and fuel the broader narrative of "resistance."
 * Western Amplifiers: This group consists of civil society organizations, hacktivist collectives, and activist groups operating in North America and Europe. They translate the narratives from state and militant actors into a format palatable for Western audiences, leveraging social justice language and existing political fault lines to mobilize support and shape public discourse.
The following sections will provide detailed dossiers for key actors within each of these pillars, demonstrating their individual roles and their collective impact on the global information landscape.
II. Entity Dossiers & Actor Profiles
This section provides in-depth profiles of prominent actors identified in the research material, structuring the information to highlight their backgrounds, operational methods, narrative profiles, and network affiliations.
A. State-Backed Media: Press TV
Biography and Background
Press TV is a state-owned Iranian news organization that broadcasts in English and French and is a division of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). The channel, headquartered in Tehran, was launched in 2007 with the explicit purpose of countering Western media outlets like the BBC and CNN. Its owner, IRIB, is the only organization legally permitted to broadcast in Iran, and its head is directly appointed by the Supreme Leader, which underscores Press TV's role as a tool of state public diplomacy and its significance within Iran's political establishment.
Platform Presence and Reach
Press TV's reach has been heavily impacted by international sanctions and regulatory actions. Its London-based limited company was dissolved in 2021 , and its broadcasting license in the United Kingdom was revoked by the Office of Communication (Ofcom) in 2012 due to regulatory breaches. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice seized dozens of websites affiliated with the Iranian government, including Press TV's domain, for violating sanctions. As a result, Press TV has pivoted to social media to maintain its audience. A recent report notes the channel has an audience of 11.5 million followers across its remaining social channels, with web traffic data indicating its primary readership is Western.
Narrative Profile
The channel's content is widely described as Iranian government propaganda that consistently promotes Iranian foreign policy. Press TV's overarching narrative is deeply anti-establishment, seeking to present "another point of view" to audiences who are exposed to what the Iranian government describes as misinformation from Western media. Its reports frequently feature Iranian officials and commentators whose views align with the regime's "message of the day". Post-October 7, Press TV has continued to serve as a key overt channel for disseminating anti-Israel and anti-American narratives in the UK, as part of a broader Iranian influence campaign. A specific video series, "Palestine Declassified," has been identified as a "foreign state hate operation" that spreads dangerous antisemitism by using social media's algorithmic biases to maximize visibility.
Disinformation and Hate Speech Record
Press TV has a documented history of spreading disinformation and hate speech. The U.S. Department of Justice has stated that it is a "component of the government of Iran disguised as news organizations or media outlets" that targets the United States with "disinformation campaigns". The channel's UK license was revoked after it aired the coerced confessions of prisoners, a breach of broadcasting regulations. The Anti-Defamation League has identified it as "one of the world's leading dispensers of conspiratorial anti-Semitism". The "Palestine Declassified" series, in particular, promotes narratives that "Zionists" control global events and have a "stranglehold" on the media, and a third of Twitter accounts promoting its content have shared left-leaning hashtags, with nearly half of comments on its website episodes classified as antisemitic.
B. Militant & Semi-State Actors: Hamas & Hezbollah
Hamas
Biography and Background
Hamas, an acronym for the "Islamic Resistance Movement" in Arabic, is a Palestinian Sunni Islamist political and military organization that emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood. It has been the de facto government of the Gaza Strip since 2007 and is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and many other countries. Hamas's charter, published in 1988, calls for the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews, though a more recent 2017 document removed these explicit references. The organization receives significant financial and technical support, as well as weapons and training, from Iran and has also been funded by private entities in Qatar, Sudan, Algeria, and Turkey.
Platform Presence and Post-Oct 7 Audience Growth
Hamas has developed a sophisticated online media strategy, heavily utilizing platforms like Telegram for propaganda and command and control. Following the October 7 attacks, the organization's online presence exploded. The main Hamas channel posted 1,145 messages on October 7 alone, while its military wing's channel nearly quadrupled in size to over 700,000 subscribers. This rapid audience growth underscores the platform's role as a critical conduit for a diverse audience, from locals in the region to foreign supporters. The use of Telegram, which has a track record of resisting content moderation, allowed the organization to disseminate graphic and unverified content quickly and widely, filling an information vacuum. This structural advantage in the information environment provides a critical operational advantage, as Hamas's narrative can spread more freely than that of other actors who are more restricted by platform policies.
Narrative Profile and Disinformation
Hamas employs a deliberate and well-defined media strategy to shape perceptions. A document from its Interior Ministry instructs social media users to refer to all killed militants as "innocent civilians" or "innocent citizens" and to frame their attacks as "resistance actions" in response to "cruel Israeli attacks". The directive advises tailoring messaging for Western audiences by emphasizing casualties and suffering rather than glorifying martyrdom. This approach is part of a "narrative of life vs. narrative of blood" strategy. A number of key disinformation claims have been propagated, including the unsubstantiated "beheaded babies" hoax , as well as using old or unrelated footage to misrepresent the conflict.
Hezbollah
Biography and Network Connections
Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shia Islamist political party and paramilitary group that was founded in 1982 with direct support from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). It is a "state within a state" in Lebanon, providing social services like schools and hospitals, and is a powerful political force. Hezbollah is a central node in Iran's "Axis of Resistance," a regional network of anti-Israel partners that also includes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The group has a long-standing and close alliance with Hamas, providing military training and media support. Since October 2023, Hezbollah has been at war with Israel, launching cross-border attacks in a show of support for Palestinians.
C. Western Proxies & Lobbying Networks: NIAC & ICG's IEI
The National Iranian American Council (NIAC)
Biography and Background
The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) is a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group founded in 2002 by Trita Parsi, Babak Talebi, and Farzin Illich. Parsi, who now serves as executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, is a notable figure in US-Iranian relations. NIAC's stated mission is to give voice to the Iranian American community and promote diplomacy. However, a court has concluded that it is "reasonable to rationally assert that NIAC is lobbying on behalf of the Iranian government".
Affiliations and Policy Positions
NIAC's affiliated PAC, NIAC Action, supports a wide range of left-leaning policies and Democratic candidates, including Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. The organization has a consistent record of opposing economic sanctions on Iran and was recognized for its lobbying efforts in support of the Iran nuclear deal. Post-October 7, NIAC has adopted a strong narrative, referring to Israel's actions as an "international atrocity" and "genocide," and has called for an end to U.S. military funding to Israel. This messaging aligns with Iran's strategic objective of isolating Israel and undermining its relationship with the United States. NIAC has faced accusations of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), with some senators claiming it amplifies "regime propaganda" in the United States.
The International Crisis Group (ICG) & Iran Experts Initiative (IEI)
Covert Ties and Allegations
The International Crisis Group (ICG), a prominent think tank, has been accused of operating a covert influence network on behalf of the Iranian government. An investigation by Iran International alleged a secret alliance between the ICG and Iran's Foreign Ministry through its in-house think tank, the Institute for Political and International Studies (IPIS). This alliance allegedly involved an undisclosed 2016 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and facilitated quarterly visits and visa assistance for ICG analysts to meet with Iranian officials. Analysts from the ICG, including Ali Vaez and Dina Esfandiary, have been accused of advocating for views aligned with the Iranian government during nuclear negotiations.
Strategic Implications
The allegations concerning the ICG's Iran Experts Initiative reveal a critical vector for state-level influence operations. The network's capacity to "launder" its propaganda through seemingly legitimate and respected Western institutions like a think tank is a potent strategic tool. It allows the Iranian government to shape policy discourse and public opinion from within, lending an academic and professional legitimacy to narratives that serve its interests. This bypasses traditional media and government scrutiny, framing a foreign influence campaign as objective policy analysis, thereby making it a more challenging threat to detect and counter.
D. Civil Society & Grassroots Activism: Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)
Biography and Background
Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) is a pro-Palestinian college student activism organization with over 350 chapters across North America. Founded in 1993 at the University of California, Berkeley, it has become a central force in campus protest and the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. A co-founder of SJP, Hatem Bazian, also founded American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), a group with alleged ties to the Hamas-affiliated Holy Land Foundation (HLF), which was shut down by the U.S. government for funding Hamas.
Funding and Narrative Profile
SJP chapters, not being registered as 501(c)(3) nonprofits, are not subject to public financial disclosure laws, though they receive some funding from university student governments. The national SJP organization is fiscally sponsored by the WESPAC Foundation. SJP's messaging is deeply rooted in the language of social justice and intersectionality, framing the conflict through the lens of human rights and liberation. The group uses this language to enlist a broad base of students who may have limited knowledge of the conflict. Post-October 7, SJP chapters and affiliates issued statements praising the Hamas attacks as a "natural and justified response," with some groups explicitly stating that "Responsibility for every single death falls solely on the Zionist entity".
Risk and Impact Assessment
SJP is a high-centrality amplifier and a critical bridge node in the influence network. It translates narratives from militant and state actors into a culturally resonant format for Western youth, making it a highly effective force for on-the-ground mobilization. Its ability to organize large-scale demonstrations, such as the student encampments in the spring of 2024, and to shape campus discourse makes it a significant driver of real-world protests and a key component of the information campaign. The organization has been criticized for using "dangerously demonizing language" about Zionists and Israel and for promoting false claims.
E. The Hybrid Actors: The Dark Storm Team
Biography and Operational Tactics
The Dark Storm Team is a hacktivist group that first emerged in late 2023, following the October 7 attacks. The group identifies as pro-Palestine and anti-NATO and has been noted for its collaboration with pro-Russia hacktivist groups, sharing similar tactics and targeting NATO countries, Israel, and the U.S.. Its operations are primarily focused on large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against critical infrastructure in Israel and allied countries, including airports, hospitals, and government websites.
The Hybrid Financial Model
The most significant aspect of the Dark Storm Team's operational model is its dual motivation: it is driven by both political ideology and financial gain. The group's political activities are a means to an end, leveraging attention from high-profile cyberattacks to advertise its illicit services, such as "DDoS-for-hire," ransomware, and the sale of stolen data on the dark web. After claiming responsibility for a global outage on X, the group launched a Solana cryptocurrency coin, DARKSTORM. The coin has an extremely low market cap and daily trading volume , suggesting it is likely a "pump and dump" scam, a common fraud on the Solana platform where scammers lure investors and then abruptly remove liquidity, making the tokens worthless.
This financial model creates a hybrid threat. By operating as an ideological hacktivist group while simultaneously running a profit-driven criminal enterprise, the Dark Storm Team's motives are deliberately obscured. This ambiguity allows the group to maintain plausible deniability, as its actions can be dismissed as opportunistic crime rather than state-backed sabotage. The targeting of critical infrastructure and the use of misinformation about the attacks are not just byproducts of their operations; they are a key strategic objective to sow "suspicion and division" and to create a climate of fear and powerlessness among its targets.
III. Cross-Cutting Analysis & Network Synthesis
This section provides a thematic analysis of the network, examining the tools and strategies that are common across the various actors and how they function together to achieve their goals.
A. The Disinformation Toolkit: AI, Bots, and Narrative Framing
The influence network leverages a sophisticated and multifaceted toolkit to wage a "world war online". A common thread is the use of inauthentic content and profiles, including AI-generated images and videos, bots, and sockpuppets. For instance, a pro-Israel campaign used AI to create fake accounts to target U.S. lawmakers , while Hamas's channels have propagated old or miscaptioned footage to mislead audiences.
The network also employs a consistent narrative framing to re-contextualize the conflict. Slogans and terms like "genocide," "colonialism," and "apartheid" are used to emotionally charge the discourse and align anti-Israel positions with broader social justice movements. This strategy, often employed by amplifiers like SJP, allows for the recruitment of new members who may have limited knowledge of the conflict.
A particularly potent tactic involves the psychological dimension of conflict. The network disseminates a narrative that denies or minimizes the trauma experienced by the Jewish community following the October 7 attacks. This form of "traumatic invalidation," where the pain of one group is neglected or outright denied, is a sophisticated psychological operation. It serves to deepen the trauma of one side while empowering the other, effectively shutting down dialogue and making it more difficult to have a fact-based discussion. This type of psychological warfare moves beyond simple lying and seeks to actively manipulate the emotional and social state of the target audience.
B. The Financial Engine: Funding & Monetization
The influence network is powered by a diverse and complex financial ecosystem, ranging from state sponsorship to decentralized cybercrime.
1. State Sponsorship and Non-Profit Conduits: Iran is the primary financial backer of its militant proxies, providing an estimated $100 million annually to groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The network also exploits Western non-profit and legal systems. The House Judiciary investigation, for instance, alleges that U.S. taxpayer money may have been funneled through American-based foundations to support anti-Netanyahu protest groups. Groups like SJP are fiscally sponsored by foundations such as the WESPAC Foundation. The financial links between the Hamas-affiliated Holy Land Foundation and SJP's founder highlight how funds can be funneled through seemingly independent entities to support the broader movement.
2. Cybercrime and Cryptocurrency: A new and significant financial trend is the rise of hybrid actors like the Dark Storm Team who use cybercrime as a monetization vector. By offering "DDoS-for-hire" and selling cryptocurrencies , they create a decentralized funding stream that is difficult to trace. This model is a key feature of the modern threat landscape, as it lowers the barrier to entry for influence operations, allowing any actor with money to purchase disruptive services and amplification.
Below is a table summarizing the financial ecosystem, linking actors to their funding sources and monetization models.
| Actor | Funding Source(s) | Estimated Value (if available) | Connection to other Actors/Groups | Type of Funding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Press TV | Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB)  | Budget: 250 billion rials (>$8.3M)  | State-owned; sister channels Al-Alam, HispanTV  | State |
| Hamas | Iran, Qatar, private donors in Persian Gulf, cryptocurrency  | $1B annual revenue  | Hezbollah, Iran's "Axis of Resistance"  | State-sponsored, private, criminal |
| Hezbollah | Iran  | Not specified | Hamas, Iran's "Axis of Resistance"  | State-sponsored |
| NIAC | Iranian-American community, American foundations  | Revenue: >$1.7M (2017)  | Left-of-center coalitions, politicians (Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib)  | Foundation, grassroot donations |
| ICG (IEI) | Undisclosed, academic  | Not specified | Iranian Foreign Ministry (IPIS)  | Foreign government (alleged) |
| SJP | Student governments, foundations (WESPAC, Headwaters), crowdfunding  | Varies by chapter  | American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), BDS movement  | Foundation, grants, institutional |
| Dark Storm Team | DDoS-for-hire, ransomware, sale of stolen data, cryptocurrency  | Not specified | Pro-Russia hacktivist groups (Killnet, Noname057)  | Criminal, hybrid |
C. Network Structure & Key Bridges
The network's strength lies in its decentralized structure and the existence of key "bridge" nodes that connect disparate communities. The following table identifies these critical actors and their roles.
| Actor | Role | Key Connections |
|---|---|---|
| Iran | Source/Funder: The central nexus of the network, providing funding, weapons, and ideological direction. | Militant Groups: Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis. <br> Western Proxies: Press TV, NIAC (alleged), ICG (alleged). |
| Press TV | Global Disseminator: An overt state-media channel that broadcasts propaganda to a Western audience. | IRIB: State-owned media organization. <br> Pro-Palestine/Anti-Israel narratives: A key disseminator of antisemitic content and Iranian foreign policy. |
| Hamas | On-the-ground Narrator: Creates and propagates raw, emotionally charged content from the conflict zone. | Iran: Primary funder and military supporter. <br> Hezbollah: Long-time strategic and military ally. <br> Telegram: Primary platform for information dissemination. |
| Dark Storm Team | Hybrid/Criminal Amplifier: A bridge between ideological hacktivism and profit-driven cybercrime. | Pro-Russia groups: Collaborates in cyberattacks. <br> Social Media: Uses Telegram for command and control, and to advertise services. |
| NIAC | Lobbying/Political Bridge: Shapes policy discourse in the West and provides a veneer of legitimacy to pro-Iran policy. | Democratic politicians: Endorses and works with left-of-center candidates. <br> Quincy Institute: Founder Trita Parsi is a key figure. |
| SJP | Grassroots Mobilizer/Amplifier: Translates core narratives into a social justice context for Western youth mobilization. | Hatem Bazian: Founder who also established AMP, a group with alleged ties to Hamas fronts. <br> BDS Movement: Key driver of boycott campaigns. |
This structure illustrates how Iran, as a source and funder, provides the ideological and financial impetus. Hamas and Hezbollah create and amplify the raw content of the "resistance." This content is then picked up and re-contextualized by Western amplifiers like SJP and NIAC, who use it to mobilize activists and shape policy debates. This network is not a traditional hierarchy but a fluid and resilient ecosystem where information and resources flow in a circular, self-sustaining pattern.
IV. Conclusions & Strategic Recommendations
A. The Multi-Pronged Threat
The analysis presented demonstrates that the anti-Israel / pro-Iran influence network is a sophisticated and multi-layered threat. It is built not on a single monolithic entity but on a diverse array of actors, each playing a specialized and interdependent role. State-level actors provide the resources and top-down control. Militant groups provide the raw, often graphic, content and operational justification. Western lobbying and activist groups provide the ideological and political legitimacy needed for local amplification. Finally, hybrid hacktivist groups introduce a criminal-for-profit element, making the entire ecosystem more resilient and harder to dismantle. The network's success lies in its ability to synchronize these disparate efforts, exploit vulnerabilities in Western legal and technological systems, and wage psychological warfare that weaponizes emotional responses and collective trauma.
B. Strategic Recommendations
Based on the findings of this report, a multi-pronged counter-strategy is recommended to monitor, counter, and build resilience against this threat.
 * Counter-Narrative Development: Traditional fact-checking is insufficient to combat a network that operates on emotional and psychological manipulation. It is recommended to develop counter-narratives that address the underlying emotional and identity-based aspects of the propaganda. This requires moving beyond simple debunks to address the feeling of "traumatic invalidation" and to provide an alternative, compelling narrative that does not cede the moral ground.
 * Targeted Asset Tracing and Legal Action: The emergence of a hybrid criminal model, as seen with the Dark Storm Team, necessitates a shift in financial monitoring. It is recommended to expand asset tracing efforts to include decentralized cryptocurrency scams and the "DDoS-for-hire" market. Furthermore, continued and aggressive legal scrutiny of Western-based non-profit organizations for potential violations of lobbying and financial regulations is essential to disrupt the network's financial and political conduits.
 * Platform Collaboration and Regulatory Engagement: The investigation highlights the critical role of platforms like Telegram as force multipliers for militant and state-backed propaganda. It is recommended to engage with technology platforms to enhance moderation policies, particularly for platforms that have historically resisted such efforts. Additionally, a proactive strategy of developing and deploying advanced AI detection tools is necessary to combat the network's use of AI-generated and inauthentic content. The goal should be to create an environment where the network's reliance on plausible deniability is no longer a viable strategy.
