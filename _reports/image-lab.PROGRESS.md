# Progress Report: Image Influence Lab Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Drag and Drop**: Implemented a custom, dependency-free drag-and-drop component for file uploads to adhere to the "no new dependencies" constraint.
-   **File Handling**: The component is client-only and handles file previews using `URL.createObjectURL`. It does not upload files to a server.
-   **Layout**: The page is structured with the main tool on one side and a safety guidelines panel on the other, providing clear instructions to the user.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next tool page: `/dashboard/tools/fact-check`.
