# Progress Report: Article Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented a dynamic route to display individual articles.
-   **Content**: The page uses mock data to simulate fetching and rendering article content.
-   **MDX**: As with the legal pages, standard JSX was used instead of MDX to avoid new dependencies. The structure is ready for an MDX upgrade.
-   **Navigation**: The page includes next and previous article links for a better user experience.

## TODO Next

-   This completes Phase 4. Proceed to **Phase 5: Trust**.
