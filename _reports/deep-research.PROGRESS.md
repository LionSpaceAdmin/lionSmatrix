# Progress Report: Deep Research Daily Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Architecture**: A client component (`DeepResearchClient`) handles the notes editor and saved queries.
-   **Persistence**: The notes editor uses `localStorage` to persist the user's work across sessions, as required.
-   **Export**: Implemented a client-side "Export as Markdown" feature that generates and downloads a `.md` file.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next dashboard route: `/dashboard/campaigns`.
