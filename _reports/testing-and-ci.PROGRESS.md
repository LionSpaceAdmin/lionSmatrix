# Progress Report: Testing & CI

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **E2E Testing**: Added Playwright for end-to-end testing. Created a basic smoke test suite and an accessibility test suite using `axe-core`.
-   **Performance Budgets**: Configured Lighthouse CI with `lighthouserc.json` to enforce performance, accessibility, and SEO budgets.
-   **CI Workflow**: Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to run the new E2E tests and Lighthouse CI checks on every push and pull request to `main`.
-   **Agent Guidance**: Updated `agents.md` to include the new testing procedures and progress reporting discipline.

## TODO Next

-   This completes Phase 7. All phases of the mission are now complete. The next step is to prepare for submission.
