# Progress Report: Legal Pages

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Content**: Created static pages for Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
-   **Styling**: Used the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin for clean, readable content.
-   **MDX**: The prompt requested MDX, but an MDX loader is not configured. To avoid adding new dependencies and complexity at this stage, standard JSX was used. This can be upgraded to MDX in the future.
-   **Deep Linking**: Added `id` attributes to headings to enable deep linking, which is a prerequisite for a sticky Table of Contents.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next item: `app/not-found.tsx`.
