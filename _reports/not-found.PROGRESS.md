# Progress Report: 404 Not Found Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Implementation**: Created a custom 404 page using the Next.js convention of `app/not-found.tsx`.
-   **User Experience**: The page provides a clear error message and helpful links to other parts of the site, including Home, Search, and the Daily Brief.
-   **Accessibility**: Added `aria-live="assertive"` to the main heading to ensure screen readers announce the "Page Not Found" state immediately.

## TODO Next

-   This completes Phase 1. Proceed to **Phase 2: Auth (Mock Only)**.
