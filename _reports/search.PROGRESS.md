# Progress Report: Search Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Architecture**: A `SearchClient` component handles all search logic client-side.
-   **Debouncing**: User input is debounced to prevent excessive searching while typing.
-   **Keyboard Navigation**: Implemented full keyboard navigation for the search results, including arrow keys to select and Enter to navigate, and Escape to close the results panel.
-   **Mock Data**: The search uses a simple, in-memory mock index for demonstration purposes.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next public route: `/legal/terms` and `/legal/privacy`.
