# Progress Report: DSR Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Form Handling**: A `DsrForm` client component handles the data subject request form.
-   **Validation**: Client-side validation is implemented with `react-hook-form` and `zod`.
-   **Mock Submission**: The form submission is mocked and provides a fake ticket ID, as required.
-   **User Experience**: An alert is displayed to inform the user about the identity verification process.

## TODO Next

-   This completes Phase 5. Proceed to **Phase 6: Enterprise**.
