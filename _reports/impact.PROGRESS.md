# Progress Report: Impact Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Lazy Loading**: The `ImpactChart` component, which includes the `recharts` library, is lazy-loaded using `next/dynamic`. This prevents the large charting library from being included in the initial page bundle, improving performance. A skeleton loader is shown while the component loads.
-   **Component Composition**: The page is built using standard `shadcn/ui` components like `Card` and `Accordion` to display the KPIs and methodology.
-   **Accessibility**: The chart component includes a fallback table for smaller screens, which also improves accessibility for screen reader users.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next public route: `/about`.
