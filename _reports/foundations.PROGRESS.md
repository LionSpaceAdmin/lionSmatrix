# Progress Report: Foundations

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Styling**: Refactored the styling foundation to use `shadcn/ui` conventions with a proper theme setup in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css`. This provides a robust and maintainable design system.
-   **i18n**: Implemented a robust i18n routing strategy using Next.js middleware. The middleware handles locale detection and URL rewriting. A centralized `t` function is available for translations.
-   **Providers**: Created a central `Providers` component to handle theme, React Query, tooltips, and RTL direction.
-   **Telemetry & Instrumentation**: Added basic, type-safe stubs for telemetry and instrumentation that are dev-only and will not impact production performance.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to **Phase 1: Public Routes** and begin scaffolding the pages.
-   Integrate the new `t` function for i18n in all new components.
-   Use the `track` function for key user interactions.
