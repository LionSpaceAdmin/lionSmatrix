# Progress Report: Archive Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Architecture**: The page uses a Server Component (`page.tsx`) to render the main layout and a Client Component (`ArchiveClient`) to handle all interactive logic. This follows the recommended React Server Components pattern.
-   **State Management**: The filter and pagination state is managed within the `ArchiveClient` component using `useState`.
-   **URL State Sync**: The `useEffect` hook is used to synchronize the component's state with the URL's search parameters, ensuring that the filters are preserved on back/forward navigation and page reloads.
-   **Loading State**: `Suspense` is used on the page level to provide an instant skeleton UI while the client component and its dependencies are loaded.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next public route: `/archive/[narrativeId]`.
