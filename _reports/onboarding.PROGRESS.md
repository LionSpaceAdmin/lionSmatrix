# Progress Report: Onboarding Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Architecture**: A client component (`OnboardingWizard`) manages the state of the multi-step form.
-   **State Management**: Local state (`useState`) is used to track the current step and the user's selections. The state is preserved when navigating back and forth between steps.
-   **Mock Logic**: The final step simulates the completion of the onboarding process and redirects the user to the `/dashboard`.

## TODO Next

-   This completes Phase 2. Proceed to **Phase 3: Dashboard & Tools**.
