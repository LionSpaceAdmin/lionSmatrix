# Progress Report: War Machine Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Layout**: The page is implemented as a grid of `Card` components, providing a clear and organized hub for accessing the various tools.
-   **Content**: Tool information (title, description, link, permission) is managed in a mock data array. This can be easily replaced with data from a real API in the future.
-   **UX**: Each card includes a mock permission badge and a disabled state for the "Open" button, giving users clear feedback on their access rights.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the first tool page: `/dashboard/tools/image-influence-lab`.
