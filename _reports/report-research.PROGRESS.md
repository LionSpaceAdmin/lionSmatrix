# Progress Report: Report & Research Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Form Handling**: A client component (`ReportForm`) handles the multi-field form, including a custom drag-and-drop file input area.
-   **Validation**: Client-side validation is implemented with `react-hook-form` and `zod`.
-   **Mock Submission**: The form submission is mocked, providing a ticket ID to the user upon successful (mock) submission, as required.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next tool page: `/dashboard/tools/fake-resistance-tracker`.
