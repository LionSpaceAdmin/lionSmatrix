# Progress Report: Fact-Check Tool Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Architecture**: A single client component (`FactCheckClient`) handles the entire multi-step process of building a fact-check report.
-   **State Management**: Local state (`useState`) is used to manage the claim, the list of evidence, and the final verdict.
-   **Dynamic UI**: The evidence list is dynamic, allowing the user to add and remove items as needed.
-   **Print-Friendly**: The page includes a print button and a print-specific CSS class (`print:prose-black`) to prepare for a print-friendly stylesheet, as per the acceptance criteria.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next tool page: `/dashboard/tools/report-research`.
