# Progress Report: Narrative Detail Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented a dynamic route that fetches and displays data based on the `narrativeId` URL parameter.
-   **Data Fetching**: The page is a Server Component that fetches its own data. A mock `getNarrative` function was created to simulate this.
-   **Not Found Handling**: The page correctly uses the `notFound()` function from Next.js to render a 404 page if the requested narrative does not exist.
-   **Dynamic Metadata**: The `generateMetadata` function is used to set the page title and description based on the narrative's data, which is crucial for SEO.
-   **Component Composition**: The page is built by composing several new placeholder components (`EvidenceList`, `Timeline`, `SharePack`) to structure the content.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next public route: `/playbooks`.
