# Progress Report: Project Stabilization and Landing Page
## Date: 2025-09-21
## Summary
This report summarizes the work done for the "Project Stabilization, CI Implementation, and Initial Feature Development (Landing Page)" directive.
### Phase I: Project Stabilization & Hardening
- **Testing Framework:**
  - **Vitest:** Successfully installed and configured for unit testing. A sample unit test for the `cn` utility function was created and verified.
  - **Playwright:** Encountered persistent timeout issues in the environment that prevented the successful setup of E2E tests. After extensive debugging, the decision was made to skip the E2E testing part of the task to avoid further delays. The Playwright dependencies and configuration files have been removed from the project for now.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - A GitHub Actions workflow has been created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
  - The CI pipeline is configured to run on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
  - The pipeline installs dependencies, runs the linter, type checker, and unit tests.
### Phase II: Initial Feature Development - Public Landing Page
- **File Structure:** The required file structure for the landing page has been created, including the content file `landing.copy.json` and the `head.tsx` file for SEO.
- **Placeholder Components:** Placeholder versions of the required UI components have been created in the `src/components/ui` directory.
- **Landing Page UI:** The basic structure of the landing page has been implemented in `src/app/(public)/page.tsx` using the placeholder components.
- **SEO:** SEO metadata, including JSON-LD and OpenGraph/Twitter cards, has been implemented in `head.tsx`.
- **QA:** The QA Gauntlet (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`) has been run successfully.
## Next Steps
- The next step is to replace the placeholder components with the actual implementation based on the design system.
- The i18n and routing for the CTAs will need to be implemented.
- The E2E testing setup needs to be revisited once the environment issues are resolved.
