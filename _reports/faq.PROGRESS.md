# Progress Report: FAQ Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Architecture**: Used a Client Component (`FaqClient`) to handle the interactive search and accordion state.
-   **Search**: Implemented a live search filter that narrows down the list of FAQs as the user types.
-   **Deep Linking**: The component uses `useEffect` to read the URL hash on mount, allowing users to link directly to a specific question. The corresponding accordion item is automatically opened and scrolled into view.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next public route: `/contact`.
