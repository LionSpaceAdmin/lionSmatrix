# Progress Report: Contact Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Form Handling**: A client component (`ContactForm`) was created to handle the form logic.
-   **Validation**: Implemented client-side validation using `react-hook-form` and `zod` to provide instant feedback to the user.
-   **Mock Submission**: The form submission is a mock that simulates a network request and shows success or failure states using the `Toaster` component, fulfilling the "no network calls" constraint.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next public route: `/search`.
