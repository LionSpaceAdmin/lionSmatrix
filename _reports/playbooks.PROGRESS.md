# Progress Report: Playbooks Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-23

## Decisions

-   **Architecture**: Followed the Server Component + Client Component pattern. The `PlaybooksClient` component handles all state and interactivity.
-   **State Management**: Local state (`useState`) is used for managing the active filter.
-   **Modal Implementation**: The playbook preview is implemented using the `Dialog` component from `shadcn/ui`, which provides accessible modal functionality out of the box.
-   **Data**: Mock data for the playbooks is defined directly within the client component for simplicity.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next public route: `/impact`.
