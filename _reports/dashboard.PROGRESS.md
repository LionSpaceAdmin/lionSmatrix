# Progress Report: Dashboard Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Architecture**: The page uses a Server Component with `Suspense` to stream in the main dashboard content, showing a skeleton loader initially.
-   **Component Composition**: The dashboard is built from smaller, self-contained components (`ThreatStrip`, `MyMissions`, and a `Quick Actions` card) for better organization and maintainability.
-   **Data**: The components use mock data to simulate a real dashboard environment.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the next dashboard route: `/dashboard/war-machine`.
