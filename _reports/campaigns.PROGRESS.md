# Progress Report: Campaigns Page

-   **Status**: Completed
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Decisions

-   **Architecture**: A `CampaignsClient` component handles the modal wizard for creating a new campaign.
-   **UX**: The "New Campaign" wizard is implemented within a `Dialog` component, allowing users to create a campaign without leaving the main page.
-   **Mock Logic**: The wizard includes a mock YAML generation and a "copy to clipboard" feature.

## TODO Next

-   Proceed to the final step of Phase 3: **Refactor temporary AI Terminal tabs**.
