This document provides a comprehensive maintenance plan for the L-M-v-S.I.l-v-e-r-L-i-n-g-S-h-e-d project.

## 1. Project Overview

The L-M-v-S.I.l-v-e-r-L-i-n-g-S-h-e-d project is a web application built with a modern tech stack. The front end is built with React (using Next.js) and the backend is a combination of Next.js API routes and potentially other services. It uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and various other libraries for a rich user experience.

## 2. Maintenance Tasks

### 2.1. Dependency Management

* **Frequency:** Bi-weekly
* **Description:** Regularly update project dependencies to their latest stable versions. This helps ensure security and access to new features.
* **Tools:** `npm outdated`, `npm update` or `pnpm update` as the project uses pnpm.

### 2.2. Code Quality and Linting

* **Frequency:** On every commit
* **Description:** Enforce a consistent code style and identify potential issues using ESLint and Prettier. The project already has scripts for this.
* **Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks (e.g., with husky).

### 2.3. Testing

* **Frequency:** On every commit and before each release
* **Description:** Run the full test suite to ensure that all existing functionality works as expected and that no regressions have been introduced. The project uses Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for end-to-end tests.
* **Tools:** Vitest, Playwright, React Testing Library

### 2.4. Performance Monitoring

* **Frequency:** Continuous
* **Description:** Monitor the application's performance to identify and address any bottlenecks or slowdowns.
* **Tools:** Sentry and Lighthouse are integrated, as seen in `package.json`.

### 2.5. Security Audits

* **Frequency:** Quarterly
* **Description:** Regularly scan for security vulnerabilities in both the application code and its dependencies.
* **Tools:** `npm audit` or `pnpm audit`. Consider integrating Snyk for more in-depth analysis.

### 2.6. Documentation Updates

* **Frequency:** As needed
* **Description:** Keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes to the codebase, API, or architecture. This includes `AGENTS.md` and any other relevant documents.

## 3. Release Process

1. **Create a release branch:** Create a new branch from `main` for the release (e.g., `release/v1.2.0`).
2. **Bump version:** Update the version number in `package.json` according to Semantic Versioning.
3. **Generate changelog:** Automatically generate a changelog based on commit messages. A tool like `conventional-changelog-cli` can be used.
4. **Run final tests:** Run the full test suite one last time: `pnpm test` and `pnpm e2e:headless`.
5. **Tag the release:** Create a new Git tag for the release.
6. **Merge to main:** Merge the release branch back into `main`.
7. **Deploy:** Deploy the new version to production. This may involve a build step (`pnpm build`) and a start script (`pnpm start`).
8. **Monitor:** Monitor the application for any issues after deployment using Sentry.
