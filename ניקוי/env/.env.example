# Example environment variables for local development.
# For production, these should be managed as environment variables in the Cloud Run service.

# --- Google Cloud Configuration ---
# Your Google Cloud Project ID
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>

# The region for your services and Vertex AI
VERTEX_LOCATION=<REGION>


# --- Database Configuration ---
# The connection string for the shared PostgreSQL database.
# For local development with Docker, this might look like:
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase"
#
# !!! IMPORTANT FOR PRODUCTION !!!
# In Cloud Run, this variable should NOT be set directly.
# Instead, the value should be injected from Secret Manager.
# The recommended secret name is '<project>-backend-db-credentials'.
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string-here"
