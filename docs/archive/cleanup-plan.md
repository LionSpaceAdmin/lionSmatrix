# Cleanup Plan (Archived)

This plan outlined non-breaking improvements for quality and DX. It has been archived to avoid duplication. See current tasks in `docs/review/quality-report.md` and `docs/tasks/repo_alignment_single_mission.md`.

Original highlights

- Refactor duplicated API backoff logic into a shared helper.
- Fix skipped/flaky tests and stabilize date-dependent assertions.
- Add `.env.example` and document required env vars.
- Tighten types for Gemini helpers.
